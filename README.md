# NRI-odin

Bindings for [Nvidia NRI](https://github.com/NVIDIA-RTX/NRI) version 177 in Odin.

D3D11, D3D12 and Vulkan are enabled in the included binaries. The Imgui extension is also enabled.

## Getting started
Copy NRI.dll to the root directory of your project to use the library. Currently, only Windows binaries are included. You can use them directly, or compile NRI from source and replace the lib and dll files yourself. 

I have made sample code for using these bindings public [here](https://github.com/steinarb1234/NRI-odin-samples).

**Credits**
- Bindings are autogenerated using [odin-c-bindgen](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/odin-c-bindgen).
- @lodinukal for the first NRI-odin bindings.
